# L402 Nginx Module

An [L402](https://docs.lightning.engineering/the-lightning-network/l402) authentication module/plugin for Nginx that integrates seamlessly into your web server, enabling Lightning Network-based monetization for your REST APIs (HTTP/1 and HTTP/2). It supports Lightning Network Daemon (LND), Core Lightning (CLN), Lightning Network URL (LNURL), and Nostr Wallet Connect (NWC) for invoice generation. The module can be configured to charge per unique API call, allowing you to monetize your endpoints based on specific request paths.

## Installation & Usage

> **Note**: This module requires **NGINX version 1.28.0** or later. Earlier versions will cause module version mismatch errors.

### Option 1: Using Docker Images (Recommended)

The easiest way to deploy the L402 Nginx module is by using our official Docker images:

```bash
# Pull the image
docker pull ghcr.io/dhananjaypurohit/ngx_l402:latest

# Run with environment variables
docker run -d \
  --name l402-nginx \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -e LN_CLIENT_TYPE=LNURL \
  -e LNURL_ADDRESS=https://your-lnurl-server.com \
  -e ROOT_KEY=your-root-key \
  ghcr.io/dhananjaypurohit/ngx_l402:latest
```

For specific versions:
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/dhananjaypurohit/ngx_l402:v1.1.2
```

### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. Download the module file `libngx_l402_lib.so` from the [latest release](https://github.com/DhananjayPurohit/ngx_l402/releases/latest) and copy it to your Nginx modules directory (typically `/etc/nginx/modules/`)

2. Enable the module in your nginx.conf:

```nginx
load_module /etc/nginx/modules/libngx_l402_lib.so;
``` 

3. Enable L402 for specific locations:

```nginx
location /protected {
    root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index  index.html index.htm;
    
    # l402 module directive:   
    l402 on;
    l402_amount_msat_default    10000;
    # Note: Dynamic pricing is handled via Redis using the request path as key
    # Example: SET /protected 15000 (sets price to 15000 msats for /protected endpoint)
    l402_macaroon_timeout 3600;  # Macaroon validity in seconds, set to 0 to disable timeout
}
```

4. Set the following environment variables in `nginx.service` (typically in `/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service`):

```

```
> **Note**: Cashu eCash support has two modes:
> - **Standard mode** (default): Accepts any Cashu tokens by synchronously calling `wallet.receive()` which contacts the mint to swap tokens during the request. Secure but slower per-request due to blocking mint API calls.
> - **P2PK mode** (optional): **P2PK-locked token mode** (NUT-11) that requires tokens to be locked to the proxy's public key. The proxy:
>   1. Derives a public key from `CASHU_P2PK_PRIVATE_KEY` and sends it in the X-Cashu header (NUT-24)
>   2. Clients must create P2PK-locked tokens to this public key
>   3. Proxy verifies tokens are locked to its public key and unlocks them with the private key
>   4. Stores unlocked proofs directly in CDK database using cached keysets (no mint swap call!)
>   5. Regular redemption task finds and redeems them via `wallet.melt()`
>   
>   Much faster per-request (milliseconds), ideal for high-traffic scenarios. Proofs stored in same CDK tables.

> **⚠️ SECURITY**: The `CASHU_WALLET_SECRET` environment variable is **CRITICAL** for security. This secret is used to generate the wallet seed. Anyone with access to this secret can steal your tokens! 
> - **Generate a strong random secret**: `openssl rand -hex 32`
> - **Never commit this to Git**
> - **Keep it in a secure environment variable or secrets manager**
> - **Different for each deployment/environment**
>
> **⚠️ SECURITY**: The `CASHU_P2PK_PRIVATE_KEY` is **EQUALLY CRITICAL** when P2PK mode is enabled. This key is used to unlock P2PK-locked tokens. Anyone with access to this key can spend tokens locked to your public key!
> - **Generate securely**: `openssl rand -hex 32`
> - **Never commit to Git or share publicly**
> - **Keep it secure alongside CASHU_WALLET_SECRET**

> **Note**: The `CASHU_WHITELISTED_MINTS` environment variable allows you to restrict which Cashu mints are accepted. If not configured, all mints will be accepted in standard mode. **In P2PK mode, whitelisted mints are REQUIRED** for security and the payment request (NUT-24).

> **Note on Fee Configuration**: The melt/redemption fee handling uses a **percentage-based approach with a minimum fallback** and **optional proof count limiting**:
> - `CASHU_MELT_MIN_BALANCE_SATS`: Minimum balance (in sats) required before attempting to melt tokens to Lightning. Balances below this are skipped to avoid wasting fees on tiny amounts. Default: 10 sats.
> - `CASHU_MELT_FEE_RESERVE_PERCENT`: Percentage of total balance to reserve for melt fees. The system calculates `fee_reserve = total_amount × (percent / 100)`. Default: 1%.
> - `CASHU_MELT_MIN_FEE_RESERVE_SATS`: Minimum fee reserve (in sats) used when the percentage calculation results in a very small amount. Final reserve = `max(percentage_fee, minimum_fee)`. Default: 4 sats.
> - `CASHU_MAX_PROOFS_PER_MELT`: Maximum number of proofs to melt in a single operation. **Logic**: `if (proof_count > limit) then select_first(limit_proofs)`. Calculates total value of selected proofs and generates invoice for that amount. Remaining proofs stay for the next redemption cycle. Set to 0 to disable (default). **Use case**: Prevent hitting mint proof limits per melt operation (e.g., mint.coinos.io has 1000 proof limit).
>
> **Example 1** - Large balance (500 sats) with 1% fee reserve:
> - Percentage fee: `500 × 1% = 5 sats`
> - Minimum fee: `4 sats`
> - Used reserve: `max(5, 4) = 5 sats`
> - Redeemable: `500 - 5 = 495 sats` to Lightning invoice
>
> **Example 2** - Small balance (50 sats) with 1% fee reserve:
> - Percentage fee: `50 × 1% = 0.5 sats`
> - Minimum fee: `4 sats`
> - Used reserve: `max(0.5, 4) = 4 sats` ← Minimum kicks in!
> - Redeemable: `50 - 4 = 46 sats` to Lightning invoice
>
> **Example 3** - Proof count limiting when exceeds mint limit:
> - **Scenario**: Have `1282 proofs` worth 13,588 sats total
> - **Setting**: `CASHU_MAX_PROOFS_PER_MELT=1000`
> - **Check**: `1282 proofs > 1000 limit` → ✅ **Limiting triggered**
> - **Action**: Select first `1000 proofs` worth ~10,600 sats
> - **Invoice**: Generate invoice for `10,600 sats` (value of selected 1000 proofs)
> - **Melt**: Send only those 1000 proofs to mint
> - **Remaining**: `282 proofs` (~2,988 sats) stay for next cycle
> - **Next cycle**: `282 proofs < 1000 limit` → melts all remaining proofs
>
> Actual melt quote fees are verified against the reserve; warnings appear if the reserve was insufficient.

> **Performance Note**: P2PK mode **eliminates the mint swap call** during request processing. The proxy derives a public key and sends it to clients via the X-Cashu header. Clients create P2PK-locked tokens to that public key. When the proxy receives a token:
>   1. Validates it locally (structure, amount, whitelist)
>   2. Verifies proofs are locked to its public key (NUT-11)
>   3. Uses cached keysets to extract proofs (one-time fetch per mint, then cached)
>   4. Unlocks proofs with private key (local cryptographic operation)
>   5. Stores unlocked proofs directly in CDK database via `wallet.receive_proofs()`
>
>   No mint swap API call! The automatic redemption task finds these proofs via `wallet.get_unspent_proofs()` and redeems them to Lightning via `wallet.melt()`. This dramatically reduces response time (from seconds to milliseconds), prevents mint overload, and enables much higher request rates.

> **Note**: The module supports dynamic pricing through Redis, allowing you to change endpoint prices in real-time without restarting Nginx. When Redis is configured, the module will check Redis for a price override before using the default price specified in the nginx configuration.

5. Set up SQLite database directory (if accepting Cashu tokens):
```bash
# One-time setup: Create directory for SQLite database
# These commands only need to be run once and persist across restarts
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/nginx
sudo chown nginx:nginx /var/lib/nginx

# Set proper permissions
sudo chmod 755 /var/lib/nginx
```

6. Restart and reload Nginx:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

**Note:** The directory setup above is **one-time only** and persists across nginx restarts. You only need to run these commands once after installation.

**Important:** Both `restart` and `reload` are needed to ensure the Cashu redemption task starts properly and you can see redemption logs.

The cdk-sqlite crate will automatically create the database file and tables when the module initializes. SQLite uses WAL mode for better concurrency. Database location: `/var/lib/nginx/cashu_tokens.db`

## ⚡ L402 Protocol Notes

This module implements the [L402 protocol](https://docs.lightning.engineering/the-lightning-network/l402) using standard Lightning Network payments. The implementation:

- **Preimage Requirement**: Only supports standard 32-byte (256-bit) Lightning preimages, as specified by the Lightning Network protocol. The preimage is verified against the payment_hash using SHA256 hashing.
- **Payment Verification**: When a client provides an L402 authorization header with a preimage, it must be exactly 32 bytes to match the Lightning Network standard.
- **Wallet Compatibility**: ⚠️ Note that some wallets like [Wallet of Satoshi](https://www.walletofsatoshi.com/) provide 48-byte preimages (non-standard), which are **not compatible** with this module. For payment use wallets that provide standard 32-byte Lightning preimages.
